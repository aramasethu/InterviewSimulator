D: Good morning Bob, how can I help you today?
P: Hi doctor, I've been experiencing acute hair loss for the last 6 weeks. It's been really stressing me out.

D: Sorry to hear that, Bob. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on? When did you first notice the hair loss, and have you noticed any other symptoms?
P: Yeah, sure. I first noticed it about 6 weeks ago, and it's been getting worse every week. I've also noticed that my scalp has been itchy and red.

D: I see. Have you tried any treatments for your hair loss yet?
P: Yeah, I've tried using some over-the-counter shampoos and conditioners, but nothing seems to be working.

D: Okay, well let's take a look at your scalp. *examines scalp* It does look quite red and inflamed. Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as dandruff or flaking?
P: Yeah, I have noticed some flaking.

D: Okay, I think I know what might be causing your hair loss. It's possible that you have a condition called seborrheic dermatitis, which can cause hair loss, redness, and flaking. I'd like to prescribe you a medicated shampoo that should help clear up the condition and stop the hair loss.

P: Okay, that sounds good. How long will it take to start working?

D: You should start to see improvements within a few weeks. In the meantime, I recommend that you avoid using any harsh chemicals or shampoos on your scalp, and try to keep it as clean and dry as possible.

P: Alright, I'll give it a try. Thanks for your help, doctor!

D: You're welcome, Bob. I'll see you back in a few weeks to check on your progress.
